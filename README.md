# Simple-Canvas-Drawing-Application
This a simple JavaScript project using jQuery to create a drawing canvas.

A user can select from one of the three default colors to draw on the canvas or click on the *New Color* button to create a new color. Move the scroll bars on the add color pane to create color and click on the *Add Color* button to select.
